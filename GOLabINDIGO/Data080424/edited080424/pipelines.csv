Of those who have uncorrected refractive error, only 33% of them have access to a pair of spectacles, which 60% of the time is likely an incorrect prescription. Key drivers included the lack of consideration of eye health in prior school health policy frameworks, the lack of guidelines for implementing vision screening during annual school health check-ups for children, poor awareness of the importance of eye health among teachers, and the lack of training resources for school nurses and teachers to provide eye health services and referrals.
